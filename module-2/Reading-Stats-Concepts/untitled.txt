### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
You know both concepts but, is there a difference? Are they synonims? Start investigating. 

As a good reference (once you have looked for some information) you have   [this](http://expected.news/value2) article.


--> Expected value is an anticipated value at some point in the future. Is obtained by multiplying each of the possible outcomes by the likelyhood of each outcome ocurring, then the total sum of them, so the average value or mean of a random variable

= sum (p(x)*x

The mean is the sum of all values / by the number of values and in other words, is the calculated in the past but is somehow equal to the expected value. 
















### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
We have told you that a lot of scientifical investigations are based on p-values. The last week, Nature magazine published [an article](http://nature.social/statistical4) regarding the problem. Start digging on it!

Don't hesitate to use more articles if you want to :)



--> P-Value: probability of obtaining results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. A smaller p-value means that there is a stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.


p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance


p-values condition on what is unknown (the assertion of interest; H~0~) and do not condition on what is known (the data).
This conditioning does not respect the flow of time and information; p-values are backward probabilities.




### Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
A/B testing is a widely used tool to understand differences between two samples. It is a way to measure the impact of something we did: 
* A marketing campaign.
* A new feature in our application. 
* A new design in our application.
* A different flow in the User Experience flow.

To do this, is very important first to design our experiment. 
* We need to know how we are measuring the impact. If people has the behaviour we want with this new implementation.
* We choose a control group (people who doesn't have/see the new change) and the group which will see the new change. 
* We think about how much data do we need.
* We measure the difference between them.

One example:
Our application has a lot of mini-games. We want people to reach the games that we think are the best but the behaviour is not the expected, they don't reach them.

So we call a designer and after a lot of work he shows us a new design for our application: we will add a botton specific for that kinf of games inviting the users to click on it:

*Click here to discover cool games!*

We think it will work but can we be sure? So instead of implementing this new botton for all users, we implement it for 10% and we compare the results with the users that didn't have it. Is there a significant difference? Is our botton working?

Read more about A/B testing with a couple of examples:

[An example with Python](http://math.social/tested3)

[A cool general explanation](http://arts.show/tested7)

So, take one single example in the articles you just read, which specific test/s would you apply? (We want you just to do a draft and think a little bit how to apply the tests you already know in this case)
